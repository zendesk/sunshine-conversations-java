  description: "# Introduction\n<aside class=\"notice\">As a stepping stone to new\
    \ and greater things, we’ve updated Sunshine Conversations API to v2. For users\
    \ wanting to access v1, please proceed <a href=\"https://docs.smooch.io/rest/v1\"\
    >here</a>. \n</aside>\n\nWelcome to the Sunshine Conversations API. The API allows\
    \ you to craft entirely unique messaging experiences for your app and website\
    \ as well as talk to any backend or external service.\n\nThe Sunshine Conversations\
    \ API is designed according to REST principles. The API accepts JSON in request\
    \ bodies and requires that the content-type: application/json header be specified\
    \ for \nall such requests. The API will always respond with an object. Depending\
    \ on context, resources may be returned as single objects or as arrays of objects,\
    \ nested within the response object.\n\nIn some cases, the API will also facilitate\
    \ cross-origin resource sharing so that it can be called from a web application.\n\
    \n<aside class=\"notice\">Note that for authenticated requests, cross-origin resource\
    \ sharing is only available to appUser scoped credentials. Attempting to call\
    \ the API from the browser using \napp or account scoped credentials will result\
    \ in a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\"\
    >same-origin policy</a> browser error. For more information, refer \nto the <a\
    \ href=\"http://docs.smooch.io/guide/authorization/#handle-credentials-with-caution\"\
    >Authorization guide</a>.</aside>\n\n## Regions\n\nSunshine Conversations is available\
    \ in the following regions. Each Sunshine Conversations region has its own API\
    \ host.\n\n| Region         | Host                       |\n| -------------- |\
    \ -------------------------- |\n| United States  | https://api.smooch.io     \
    \ |\n| European Union | https://api.eu-1.smooch.io |\n\nFor more information on\
    \ regions, visit [the guide](/guide/regions/).\n\n<aside class=\"notice\">When\
    \ configuring an API host, make sure to always use `https`. Some API clients can\
    \ have unexpected behaviour when following redirects from `http` to `https`.</aside>\n\
    \n## Errors\n\nSunshine Conversations uses standard HTTP status codes to communicate\
    \ errors. In general, a `2xx` status code indicates success while `4xx` indicates\
    \ an error, in which case, the response body includes a JSON object which includes\
    \ an array of errors, with a text `code` and `title` containing more details.\
    \ Multiple errors can only be included in a `400 Bad Request`. A `5xx` status\
    \ code indicates that something went wrong on our end.\n\n```javascript\n{\n \
    \  \"errors\":  [\n    {\n        \"code\": \"unauthorized\",\n        \"title\"\
    : \"Authorization is required\"\n    }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n## API Version\n\nThe\
    \ latest version of the API is v2. Version v1.1 is still supported and you can\
    \ continue using it but we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version. To\
    \ learn more about API versioning at Sunshine Conversations, including instructions\
    \ on how to upgrade to the latest version, [visit our docs](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/versioning).\n\
    \n## API Pagination and Records Limits\n\nSome APIs can be paginated by providing\
    \ the `offset` query string parameter.\n\nThe `offset` is the number of initial\
    \ records to skip before picking records to return (default 0).\n\nThe `limit`\
    \ query string can also be provided to change the number of records to return\
    \ (maximum\n100, default 25).\n\nAll paginated endpoints will eventually support\
    \ cursor pagination and `offset` based pagination support will be dropped.\n\n\
    ### Cursor Pagination\n\nSome APIs are paginated through cursor pagination. Rather\
    \ than providing an `offset`, a `page[after]` or `page[before]` query string parameter\
    \ may be provided. `page[after]` and `page[before]` are cursors pointing to a\
    \ record id.\n\nThe `page[after]` cursor indicates that only records **subsequent**\
    \ to it should be returned.\n\nThe `page[before]` cursor indicates that only records\
    \ **preceding** it should be returned.\n\n**Only one** of `page[after]` or `page[before]`\
    \ may be provided in a query, not both.\n\nIn cursor pagination, the equivalent\
    \ to the `limit` query string is the `page[size]` query string parameter.\n\n\
    ## API Libraries\n\nSunshine Conversations provides an official API library for\
    \ [Java](https://github.com/zendesk/sunshine-conversations-java), with more languages\
    \ to come. These helpful libraries wrap calls to the API and can make interfacing\
    \ with Sunshine Conversations easier.\n\n## Postman Collection\n\n<a style=\"\
    display:inline-block;background:url(https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg);height:30px;width:\
    \ 123px;\" href=\"https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/0c7cc8fc66039065d20f\"\
    ></a> \n\nIn addition to API libraries, Sunshine Conversations also has a Postman\
    \ collection that can be used for development or testing purposes. See the [guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/postman-collection/)\
    \ for information on how to install and use the collection in your Postman client.\n\
    \n## Rate Limits\n\nSunshine Conversations APIs are subject to rate limiting.\
    \ If the rate limit is exceeded Sunshine Conversations may return a `429 Too Many\
    \ Requests` HTTP status code. We apply rate limits to prevent abuse, spam, denial-of-service\
    \ attacks, and similar issues. Our goal is to keep the limits high enough so that\
    \ any application using Sunshine Conversations as intended will not encounter\
    \ them. However usage spikes do occur and encountering a rate limit may be unavoidable.\
    \ In order to avoid production outages, when calling the Sunshine Conversations\
    \ API you should implement `429` retry logic using exponential backoff and jitter.\n\
    \nIf your use case involves making API calls in bulk, please [contact us](https://smooch.io/contact).\n\
    \n## Request Size Limits\n\nThe Sunshine Conversations API imposes the following\
    \ size limits on HTTP requests:\n\n| Request Type   | Limit           |\n| --------------\
    \ | --------------- |\n| JSON           | 100kb           |\n| File upload\t |\
    \ 25mb            |\n\n## Authorization\n\nThis is an overview of how authorization\
    \ works with the Sunshine Conversations API. Sunshine Conversations allows basic\
    \ authentication or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as authentication methods for server-to-server\
    \ calls. [See below](#authentication) for more details.\nThere are two different\
    \ authorization scopes available - app and account.\n\n| Scope          | Authorized\
    \ Methods                        |\n| -------------- | -----------------------------------------\
    \ |\n| app            | All methods besides Account Provisioning  |\n| account\
    \   \t | All methods                               |\n\nThe app scope can be used\
    \ to access any of the Sunshine Conversations APIs, besides account provisioning\
    \ methods, on behalf of a single app, or any app user related to that app. The\
    \ account scope can be used to access any of the Sunshine Conversations and Account\
    \ Provisioning APIs on behalf of the account owner, any app belonging to the account,\
    \ or any app user related to those apps.\n\n<aside class=\"notice\">An additional\
    \ scope of `appUser` can also be used to authenticate users when using one of\
    \ the Sunshine Conversations native SDK integrations. For information on how and\
    \ when to use this scope, see the guide for <a href=\"https://docs.smooch.io/guide/authenticating-users/\"\
    >authenticating users.</a></aside>\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo authenticate requests\
    \ to the API, you will need an API key, composed of a key id and a secret.\nFor\
    \ an overview of how authentication works in Sunshine Conversations and instructions\
    \ on how to generate an API key, see the guide.\nAPI requests can be authenticated\
    \ in two ways:\n * With Basic authentication you can make requests using an API\
    \ key directly.\n * With JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) you sign tokens with an API key,\
    \ which are then used to authenticate with the API. See [When to Use JWTs?](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/jwt/#when-to-use-jwts)\
    \ to learn if JWTs are relevant for your usage.\n * Before using an API key in\
    \ production, make sure to familiarize yourself with best practices on how to\
    \ [securely handle credentials](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/authentication-secure-credential-handling/).\n\
    \n### Basic Authentication\n\nAPI requests can be authenticated with [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)\
    \ using an API key. The key id is used as the username and the secret as the password.\
    \ The scope of access is determined by the owner of the API key. See the [guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/basic-authentication/#scope-of-access)\
    \ for more details.\n\n### JWTs\n\nJSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an industry standard\
    \ authentication method. The full specification is described [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),\
    \ and a set of supported JWT libraries for a variety of languages and platforms\
    \ can be found at http://jwt.io. To summarize, a JWT is composed of a header,\
    \ a payload, and a signature. The payload contains information called claims which\
    \ describe the subject to whom the token was issued.\nThe JWT itself is transmitted\
    \ via the HTTP `authorization` header. The token should be prefixed with “Bearer”\
    \ followed by a space. For example: `Bearer your-jwt`.\nTo generate a JWT, you\
    \ need an API key, which is composed of a key ID and a secret. The key ID is included\
    \ in a JWT’s header, as the `kid` property, while the secret is used to sign the\
    \ JWT.\nFor more in-depth coverage, see the [guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/jwt).\n\
    \n#### Header \n\nThe JWT header must contain the key id (kid) of the API key\
    \ that is used to sign it. The algorithm (alg) used should be HS256. Unsigned\
    \ JWTs are not accepted.\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"alg\": \"HS256\",\n    \"\
    typ\": \"JWT\",\n    \"kid\": \"act_5963ceb97cde542d000dbdb1\"\n}\n```\n\n####\
    \ Payload\nThe JWT payload must include a scope claim which specifies the caller’\
    s scope of access.\n\n * account-scoped JWTs must be generated with an API key\
    \ associated with a Sunshine Conversations account (act_) or service account (svc_).\n\
    ```javascript\n{\n    \"scope\": \"account\"\n}\n```\n * app-scoped JWTs can be\
    \ generated with an API key associated with an app (app_).\n ```javascript\n{\n\
    \    \"scope\": \"app\"\n}\n ```"

    \ subset of apps. For software makers that create apps on behalf of separate customers\
    \ or businesses, service accounts can be used to generate and distribute credentials\
    \ that only have access to a single business's data.\n"

    You can upload files of any type that can then be used to send a file, image or carousel message to a user.

    ## Attachments for Messages
    The attachments API allows you to upload a file for the purpose of sending a message.
    Using the for parameter, you can signal to Sunshine Conversations that your upload will be used to send a message to a user.
    Knowing this, Sunshine Conversations will safely delete the attachment when the message, conversation or user is deleted.

      description: Deletes the switchboard integration. If the deleted switchboard
        integration had an active status for some conversations, the default switchboard
        integration will replace it. Note that it is forbidden to delete a switchboard
        integration if it's the default one (a new one must be chosen first) or if
        another switchboard integration's `nextSwitchboardIntegrationId` refers to
        it. The integration that was linked to the deleted switchboard integration
        will start receiving all conversation events, regardless of the switchboard
        status.

        A webhook payload contains an array of events, which may or may not originate from the same user
        or conversation. When processing webhook payloads, your application should take care to process
        each event in the array.
